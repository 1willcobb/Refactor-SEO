## 01 HTML, CSS, and Git: Code Refactor

## My Task

My task was to complete the first weeks homework asignment which was to refactor a index.html and a related style.css. 

## What I acomplished

* I found several issues with the index.html file and adjusted those to be more semantic removing all the Divs. 

* I then progressed through other issues found including creating alt text for every image. 

* Next I tackled the CSS file. There was way too much repetition in the code and it needed refactoring. Several classes were brought into 1 when noticing repetition and sections were moved around to fit a semantic structure.
